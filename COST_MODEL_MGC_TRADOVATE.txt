# COST MODEL – MGC MICRO GOLD (TRADOVATE)

This document defines numerical execution cost assumptions
used by the Realized RR Engine defined in CANONICAL_LOGIC.md.

These values are PARAMETERS, not rules.
They may change without altering canonical logic.

---

## Contract Specification

Symbol: MGC (Micro Gold)
Tick Size: 0.10
Tick Value: $1.00
Point Value: $10.00

---

## Measured Broker Costs (Tradovate – From Performance Report)

Observed:
- Total Trade Fees & Commission: $1,273.72
- Total Contracts Traded: 1,060
- Total Trades: 231

Derived:
- Avg fee per contract-side ≈ $1.20
- Avg round-trip fee per 1-lot ≈ $2.40

---

## Execution Cost Assumptions (Conservative Default)

Per contract, round-trip:

- Commission + exchange + NFA: $2.40
- Slippage (normal conditions): 4 ticks = $4.00
- Spread: 1 tick = $1.00

### Total Friction per Trade
$7.40 per contract (conservative, reality-anchored)

---

## RR Calculation (REALIZED)

Risk_$ =
(|Entry − Stop| × 10) + 7.40

Reward_$ =
(|Target − Entry| × 10) − 7.40

Realized_RR =
Reward_$ / Risk_$

---

## Stress Testing

Increase slippage assumption:
- Moderate stress: 8 ticks ($8)
- Severe stress: 12–15 ticks ($12–15)

---

## Usage Rules

- Use this model for backtests, expectancy, and prop-firm analysis
- Do NOT subtract costs after RR is calculated
- Costs MUST be embedded in risk and reward
- Update this file if broker, fees, or execution conditions change
