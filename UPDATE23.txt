GUARDIAN MODE ACTIVE.

TASK: Make code-guardian an ACTUAL enforced project skill + hooks. Self-detect current repo state. No assumptions.

PASS 1 (AUDIT ONLY):
1) Confirm skill discovery paths:
   - List .claude/skills/*
   - List skills/*
   - Run /skills and note whether code-guardian appears and under which section.
2) Open and review:
   - .claude/settings.json
   - .claude/settings.local.json
   Identify any existing hooks or enforcement commands.
3) Inventory gates currently used by this project:
   - scripts/check/app_preflight.py
   - test_app_sync.py
   - pytest -q
   - scripts/check/check_time_literals.py
4) Identify “protected paths” from GUARDIAN.md and reconcile with code-guardian tiers.
5) Output a short plan:
   - exact files to change
   - exact hook(s) to add
   - how to make backups Windows-safe
STOP.

PASS 2 (BUILD):
1) Move repo skill to .claude/skills/code-guardian if needed.
2) Update SKILL.md:
   - remove stale file references (only list files that exist)
   - replace cp/date backups with PowerShell-safe backups
   - align forbidden paths with GUARDIAN.md
3) Add hooks in .claude/settings.json so BEFORE edits/commit:
   - run app_preflight, test_app_sync, pytest, check_time_literals
   - block if fail
4) Prove:
   - /skills shows code-guardian
   - hook runs gates automatically (show output)
STOP.
