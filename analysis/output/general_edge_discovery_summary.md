## OBJECTIVE

Identify whether the GENERAL IDEA behind 1000 ORB + L4 can be reproduced
in other time windows or sessions - without reusing the same rules.

## PROVEN EDGE PATTERN (Baseline)

**1000 ORB + L4 Consolidation:**
- Sample: N=90
- Win Rate: 64.4%
- Expectancy: +0.926R
- Edge vs Random: +0.254R

**Abstract Pattern:**
1. COMPRESSION: London consolidates inside Asia range (low volatility)
2. FRESHNESS: Signal tested within 3 hours of formation
3. TRIGGER: ORB breakout (first 1min close outside range)
4. FOLLOW-THROUGH: 4-hour window for target development

## CANDIDATE PATTERNS TESTED

### APPROVED:
None. No new edges discovered.

### FAILED (Did Not Beat Random):

- london_compressed + 1800_orb: Edge=-0.179R (N=167)
- multi_compressed + 0900_orb: Edge=-0.443R (N=96)
- multi_compressed + 1000_orb: Edge=-0.216R (N=96)
- multi_compressed + 1100_orb: Edge=-0.054R (N=96)

## KEY FINDINGS

1. **No new edges discovered beyond L4 + 1000 ORB**
   - Tested various compression patterns (asia, london, multi-session)
   - Tested various triggers (0900/1000/1100/1800 ORBs)
   - None beat random baseline or passed validation

2. **The L4 pattern is unique**
   - Specific compression definition (London INSIDE Asia) matters
   - Generic compression (low range) is not sufficient
   - Timing (freshness) is critical

3. **HONESTY OVER OUTCOME**
   - Better to discover lack of edges in research than live trading
   - Focus resources on proven edge (1000 ORB + L4)
   - No need to force discovery when none exists
