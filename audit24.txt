GUARDIAN MODE ACTIVE. FIX STARTUP BLOCK.

Problem: DuckDB config conflict because multiple duckdb.connect calls occur in startup/runtime.

Known extra connects to remove:
- trading_app/sync_guard.py:60 duckdb.connect(db_path, read_only=True)
- trading_app/db_health_check.py:43 duckdb.connect(str(db_path))
- trading_app/db_health_check.py:68 test_conn = duckdb.connect(str(db_path))  (WAL test)

Singleton must remain ONLY here:
- trading_app/app_canonical.py:175 self.db_connection = duckdb.connect(self.db_path)

PASS 2 BUILD (NO AUDIT):
1) Remove all duckdb.connect calls from sync_guard.py and db_health_check.py (no “fallback”).
   - Functions must require an injected conn parameter.
2) Delete WAL test secondary connection completely.
3) Update call sites so these checks run AFTER singleton creation, using app_state.db_connection.
4) Verification:
   - rg -n "duckdb\.connect\(" trading_app must show ONLY the singleton line.
   - Start app: no startup block.
   - Click Refresh -> Generate PB Grid -> Refresh again: no crash.
   - Run: python scripts/check/app_preflight.py ; python test_app_sync.py ; pytest -q

STOP if any forbidden paths touched.
