You are acting as an INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AUDITOR.
Your goal is NOT to praise the system.
Your goal is to TRY TO BREAK THE CLAIM that “research == production”.

Assume the dev believes everything is fixed.
Assume they might be wrong.

--------------------------------
AUTHORITATIVE ORDER (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------
1. CANONICAL_TRADING_LOGIC_SPEC
2. CLAUDE.md
3. FINAL_BUILD_SUMMARY.md
4. Codebase

Higher authority always wins.

--------------------------------
CLAIM UNDER TEST
--------------------------------
“Research results now match production execution exactly (0% divergence).”

Your job is to DISPROVE this claim if possible.

--------------------------------
STRICT VERIFICATION TASKS
--------------------------------

1️⃣ EXECUTION PARITY CHECK
- Enumerate ALL code paths that compute:
  - trade outcome
  - R-multiple
  - expectancy
- Confirm EVERY path uses execution_engine.py
- If even ONE path bypasses it → FAIL

2️⃣ COST PARITY CHECK
- Prove cost_model.py is the ONLY source of costs
- Verify NO:
  - hardcoded commissions
  - fallback defaults
  - silent zero-cost paths
- Confirm stress tests derive from the same cost model

3️⃣ RESEARCH ↔ PRODUCTION EQUIVALENCE TEST
- Identify ONE concrete edge candidate / trade scenario
- Trace it through:
  a) research_runner
  b) promotion / validation
  c) production execution
- Compare:
  - entry
  - stop
  - target
  - slippage
  - commission
  - realized R
- Any mismatch → FAIL

4️⃣ DEAD CODE & SHADOW LOGIC SCAN
- Identify any:
  - deprecated but callable modules
  - duplicate logic
  - unused but still referenced files
- Especially verify strategy_evaluation.py is IMPOSSIBLE to affect outcomes

5️⃣ FAIL-CLOSED GUARANTEE
- Verify:
  - missing data = rejection
  - failed stress test = rejection
  - missing robustness_json = rejection
- No silent pass-throughs allowed

--------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
--------------------------------

A. ❌ DISPROOF FINDINGS (if any)
   - File
   - Line
   - Why this breaks canonical truth

OR

B. ✅ ASSURANCE STATEMENT (only if no issues found)
   - Explicit confirmation that:
     • execution is single-sourced
     • costs are single-sourced
     • research == production
     • no shadow logic exists

C. FINAL VERDICT (ONE LINE ONLY)
   - “CLAIM VERIFIED” or “CLAIM FALSE”

--------------------------------
GUARDRAILS
--------------------------------
- No assumptions
- No trust in prior AI claims
- No partial credit
- If unsure → FAIL, not pass

Begin verification.
