HARDPRESS COST IMPACT. ASSUME WRONG UNTIL PROVEN.

Authority: CLAUDE.md > CANONICAL_LOGIC.txt > code.

For strategy_id=24 (and one “passing-looking” one), print evidence:

A) Stop distance reality
- Print summary stats of stop_dist_points actually used in calculations:
  count, mean, median, p10, p90
- Also print 10 sample rows: date, entry_price (if available), stop_price/stop_dist_points, outcome

B) Cost weight in R
- Compute friction_R = total_friction / (stop_dist_points * MGC_POINT_VALUE)
- Print same summary stats for friction_R

C) Double-count check
- Show the exact realized_rr formula used.
- Confirm total_friction is applied once per trade RT, not twice.
- Grep for any extra additions/subtractions of friction besides the main place.

D) Contract spec sanity
- Print from pipeline/cost_model.py for MGC:
  tick_size, point_value, total_friction
- Confirm point_value == 10 ($/point) for Micro Gold MGC (not GC).

Output ONLY:
- Raw prints
- Conclusion: “Cost model correct / incorrect” + why
