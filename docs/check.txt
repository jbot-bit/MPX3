Claude — I need you to sanity-check my backtest results for two separate questions that overlap:

1) ORDER TYPE: Market vs Limit (execution cost/price effects)
2) ENTRY TYPE: Close-confirm vs Touch/penetration (signal/trigger effects)

Your job:
- Treat these as TWO different experiments and make sure I’m not mixing them.
- Tell me if my comparisons are fair, and if not, how to restructure them.

What to do:
1) Read the output I paste.
2) Identify which comparisons are:
   - “execution-only” (same trigger, different order)
   - “strategy/entry change” (different trigger/entry condition)
3) Check for common backtest biases:
   - lookahead
   - same-bar ordering issues (entry vs stop/TP)
   - unrealistic limit fills from OHLC
   - risk not recalculated from actual entry to stop
   - cost handling inconsistent across modes
4) Tell me:
   - What is actually proven by my results (in plain English)
   - What is NOT proven
   - The single best next test to run to confirm robustness

Output format:
- Bullet points
- Clear verdicts: “execution conclusion”, “entry conclusion”
- List any red flags + what to change

I will paste:
- the relevant code snippet(s) OR the trigger/fill rules
- the summary tables (R/opp, fill rate, win rate)
