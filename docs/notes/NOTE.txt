NOTE; Step 1: RR vs. Expectancy (The Distinction)
• Source Confirmation: P&L Ledger defines R as simply the initial risk per trade (structure), whereas Expectancy is the mathematical mean outcome over a series of trades (edge).
• The Math: You are correct that they are not interchangeable. A strategy with a high Reward-to-Risk (RR) target (e.g., 3:1) can easily have a negative expectancy if the win rate is insufficient to cover losses and friction. As noted in Tradeciety, a 3:1 ratio requires a 25% win rate just to break even before costs; if you win 20%, you have a 3R structure but a losing system.
Step 2: What is "Good" Expectancy?
• Source Confirmation: Your range of +0.166R to +0.308R aligns with "allocator-grade" alpha.
    ◦ The "Forecast-to-Fill" institutional gold strategy, which achieved a Sharpe Ratio of 2.88 (considered exceptional), had a Payoff Ratio of 1.49x (approx 1.5R) and a win rate of 65.8%.
    ◦ The expectancy per active day was roughly +2.58 basis points. In R-terms, consistent positive expectancy after friction is rare.
• Verdict: Your current stats indicate a "strong positive expectancy process". Demanding more is unnecessary and likely dangerous.
Step 3: Why +2R Expectancy is Wrong
• Source Confirmation: Quantitative Frameworks warns that "chart-perfect" R ratios often ignore the physical realities of the market.
    ◦ If you had a true +2R expectancy (not target), you would be generating 200% return on risk on average every single trade.
    ◦ The "Honesty" Gap: In reality, friction (slippage, spread, fees) turns a theoretical 2R target into a realized 1.6R or lower.
    ◦ Impact: Attempting to force a +2R expectancy usually leads to "overfitting"—creating rules that look perfect on past data but fail in live trading because they rely on rare, high-volatility events that may not repeat.
Step 4: Where "2R" Belongs (Structure, Not Outcome)
• Source Confirmation: "2R" belongs in the Trade Structure (Target/Stop), not the Expectancy column.
• The Formula: As detailed in Quantitative Frameworks, the realized outcome is: 
Realized R= 
(Entry−Stop)+Costs
(Target−Entry)−Costs
​
 
 Even if you structure a trade as 2:1 (Reward:Risk), execution friction decreases the numerator and increases the denominator, lowering the realized R.
• Conclusion: Your calculation ((0.41 * 2.0) - (0.59 * 1.0) = +0.23R) is the Gross Expectancy. Your observation that Net Expectancy drops to +0.06R after friction is consistent with professional cost modeling.
Step 5: The Role of Filters (Removal, Not Magic)
• Source Confirmation: Filters work exactly as you described—by removing "mathematically insolvent" trades rather than magically adding profit.
    ◦ MQL5 Session Trading: Explicitly states that "trading less can mean earning more" by avoiding sessions (like Asia) where your strategy's edge is diluted by chop.
    ◦ Liquidity Shocks: Your TCA (Transaction Cost Analysis) filter acted as a "Minimum Viable Risk" gate. As established in our previous turn, rejecting trades where the cost is >20% of the stop distance prevents you from entering trades that start with a massive mathematical disadvantage.
    ◦ Result: By cutting the "dead wood" (trades with negative realized R), the average expectancy of the remaining trades naturally jumps, exactly as you observed.
Step 6: The Correct Mental Model (The Layers)
Your "Layered" approach is fully supported by the literature:
1. Raw Structure: Often negative/neutral due to the "Honesty Gap" (Spread/Slippage).
2. Viability Gate (TCA): Removes trades where Cost > Edge. This is the "Safety Valve" described in Forecast-to-Fill regarding capacity and cost constraints.
3. Filters (Time/Vol): Aligns the strategy with the correct "Regime" (e.g., trading trends only during London/NY volume).
4. Execution: Improvements like "Free Trade" scaling or active management add incremental gains to the realized R.
Final Decision: You are correct to reject the demand for +2R expectancy. It is a retail myth. Stick to your current metrics (+0.16R to +0.30R), which represent a sustainable, professional edge.




Step 1 — Clear the confusion: RR vs Expectancy

You’re mixing two different things:

RR (reward:risk target) → per-trade payoff shape (e.g. 2R, 3R)

Expectancy (avg net_R per trade) → edge quality

They are not interchangeable.

A strategy with 2R targets can still have:

−0.10R expectancy (bad)

+0.05R expectancy (meh)

+0.25R expectancy (excellent)

So no — a “good edge” does not mean +2R expectancy.
That would be unrealistically huge.

Step 2 — What is a realistic good expectancy?

After friction, after TCA, after reality:

Professional ranges (net_R per trade):

+0.02R to +0.05R → viable but fragile

+0.05R to +0.10R → decent edge

+0.10R to +0.20R → strong edge

+0.20R to +0.30R → exceptional

> +0.30R → rare / usually regime-dependent

Your current +0.166R to +0.308R after TCA is already very strong.

Step 3 — Why +2R expectancy is wrong

If expectancy were +2R:

You’d double risk every trade

Win rate could be ~30% and still explode equity

Funds would arbitrage it away

Slippage alone would destroy it live

In real futures trading:

+0.1R is already elite

+0.2R is outstanding

Anything above that is usually:

Overfit

Short-lived

Or hiding unaccounted risk

Step 4 — So where does “2R” actually belong?

Here:

RR = 2.0 → trade structure

Expectancy = function of RR + win rate − friction

Example:

RR = 2.0
Win rate = 41%
Loss rate = 59%

Gross expectancy:
(0.41 × 2.0) − (0.59 × 1.0) = +0.23R

After friction (~0.17R):
Net expectancy ≈ +0.06R


That’s a real, tradeable edge.

Step 5 — How much do filters actually add?

This is the key insight.

Filters do not add edge linearly. They do three things:

Remove high-friction trades

Increase conditional win rate

Reduce variance (drawdowns)

Typical realistic gains:

+0.05R to +0.10R → good filter

+0.10R to +0.15R → excellent filter

> +0.15R → rare / high risk of overfit

What your TCA filter did:

Didn’t “optimize”

Just removed mathematically insolvent trades

Result: +0.2R swing in expectancy

That’s why it felt like a breakthrough.

Step 6 — The correct mental model (lock this in)

Think in layers:

Raw structure
→ Often −0.2R to 0.0R (because friction)

Risk viability gate (TCA)
→ Removes dead trades
→ Can flip expectancy positive

Filters (time, volatility, regime)
→ Add +0.05R to +0.15R

Execution improvements
→ Smaller incremental gains

If you demand +0.2R before filters, you’ll kill everything.
