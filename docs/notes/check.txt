RR SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH = validated_setups (DuckDB). FAIL CLOSED.

Implement a single loader used everywhere:

Function: load_validated_setups(conn, instrument='MGC') -> List[dict]
Must return: id, orb_time, rr, sl_mode, filter_name/filter_sql, direction/entry_model if stored.

MANDATORY:
1) Query validated_setups and print schema:
   DESCRIBE validated_setups;

2) Query actual configs and print an evidence table:
   SELECT id, instrument, orb_time, rr, sl_mode, filter
   FROM validated_setups
   WHERE instrument='MGC'
   ORDER BY id;

3) Enforce:
   - rr is not NULL
   - rr >= 1.5 by default (unless --allow-low-rr)
   - sl_mode not NULL
   If any fail: raise RuntimeError and stop.

4) Remove RR_DEFAULT=1.0 from populate_tradeable_metrics.py.
   Replace with per-strategy rr from validated_setups.

5) Validator must ALSO use the same loader function.
   No duplicated querying.

6) Add regression test:
   - If validated_setups rr != 1.0, ensure populated tradeable target uses that rr (sample 3 ids).
   - If rr is NULL, script must exit non-zero (fail closed).

After changes:
- Repopulate tradeable metrics for all 745 days.
- Re-run validator IDs 20–27 and show new table.
