Yes. app_canonical.py is the one.

Do NOT touch any other app_*.py.

Now implement the grouped ORB-variant display INSIDE app_canonical.py only:

Requirements:
1) Read from validated_setups + validated_trades.
2) Group by ORB time.
3) Collapsed view: 1 row per ORB showing BEST approved variant (by expectancy) + sample + winrate + friction-pass%.
4) Expand view: show all variants under that ORB (RR 1.5/2/2.5/3 etc), each with checkbox.
5) Enforce: user can select MAX 1 variant per ORB (hard block, not just warning).
6) Default ordering: ORBs sorted by best expectancy desc (or by session time if you prefer).
7) No emojis (Windows cp1252). Use plain text labels.

Before coding:
- Show where in app_canonical.py Production zone displays “validated setups” now (line numbers).
- Insert this UI in Production zone near that section (minimal diffs).

After coding:
- Show a screenshot-equivalent: exact headings + what columns are displayed.
- Run the app and confirm no encoding errors.
