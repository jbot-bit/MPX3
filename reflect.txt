# SKILL: reflect (session learning)

## Purpose
Capture useful learnings from the current session and update relevant skill files with flexible defaults.

## What to extract (signals)
- **Corrections**: user changed code, naming, architecture, UI, tests, or phrasing.
- **Approvals**: user said “yes / that’s right / do that / ship it”.
- **Repeated friction**: same mistake or preference showed up more than once.
- **Context-specific wins**: something worked well *in this project*.

## How to write memories (avoid boxing)
Write updates as:
- **Default preference**: “Default to X…”
- **Preference strength**: “Prefer / Default / Usually / Sometimes / Avoid”
- **Exception clause**: “Unless Y…”
- **Scope**: “In this repo / In this module / In UI code / In research scripts”

Never write memories as universal absolutes unless explicitly required.

## Confidence levels
- **High**: explicitly stated rule with clear scope and exception.
- **Medium**: repeated preference or validated pattern.
- **Low**: tentative observation—log as “Consider” not “Do”.

## Output format (propose, don’t apply)
1) **Detected signals** (quote short snippets)
2) **Proposed updates** grouped by target skill file
3) **Risk check**: could this overfit or box the user in?
4) **Diff preview**
5) Ask: **Apply? (Y/n)** and offer edits in natural language.

## Guardrails
- Do not add rigid rules about style unless the user explicitly wants it.
- Prefer “small, reversible” changes (1–5 bullets).
- If uncertain, log to a “review later” section instead of enforcing.
- Never overwrite existing rules; append or refine with scope/exception.

## Where to write updates
Choose the closest matching file:
- `skills/code_review.md`
- `skills/testing.md`
- `skills/frontend.md`
- `skills/backend.md`
- `skills/project_conventions.md`
- Or create `skills/_pending_review.md` for low-confidence items.

## Suggested commit message
