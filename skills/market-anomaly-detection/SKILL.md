# Market Anomaly Detection Skill

## 1. Core Purpose

This skill serves as a specialized backend service for the **Live Edge Discovery & Market Awareness Terminal**. Its primary function is to run in the background, continuously scanning for and identifying market anomalies that could impact trading decisions.

The data generated by this skill is fed directly into the terminal's **Market Awareness Dashboard** to provide the user with real-time warnings and context about current market conditions.

## 2. Anomalies Detected for the Terminal

This skill is responsible for detecting the following key market anomalies, which are then displayed in the terminal's UI:

### 1. ORB Size Anomalies
-   **Detection:** Checks if the current Opening Range Breakout (ORB) size is statistically unusual (e.g., > 3 standard deviations from the historical mean for that specific ORB).
-   **Terminal Integration:** If an anomaly is detected, a warning such as `"WARNING: 0900 ORB size is 3.5x larger than normal (Trap Risk)"` is sent to the Market Awareness panel.

### 2. Liquidity Anomalies
-   **Detection:** Monitors if the current market volume is significantly below its historical average for the current session (e.g., < 50% of normal).
-   **Terminal Integration:** Displays a status like `"ALERT: Liquidity is 65% below normal (Holiday Trading)"` in the terminal, warning of potential slippage and wider spreads.

### 3. Spread Anomalies
-   **Detection:** Tracks the current bid-ask spread and flags when it is significantly wider than normal (e.g., > 2x the typical spread for the instrument).
-   **Terminal Integration:** Provides a real-time alert, such as `"CRITICAL: Spreads are 3x wider than normal. Edge is compromised."`, which is prominently displayed to the user.

### 4. Volume Spikes
-   **Detection:** Identifies sudden, extreme spikes in volume that may indicate a news event or other unscheduled market-moving activity.
-   **Terminal Integration:** Pushes an alert to the terminal: `"INFO: Unusual volume spike detected. Check for breaking news."`

## 3. Integration with the Terminal

-   **Service, Not a Standalone Tool:** This skill is not intended to be used directly by the user. Instead, the `Live Edge Discovery & Market Awareness Terminal`'s backend calls this skill on a regular, automated schedule.
-   **Data Provider:** The skill's output is a structured data feed (e.g., a JSON object) containing a list of any active anomalies.
-   **UI Responsibility:** The terminal is responsible for taking this data and rendering it in a user-friendly way in the Market Awareness panel, including the appropriate warning levels (e.g., "WARNING", "ALERT", "CRITICAL").

By focusing on providing this specific, real-time data feed, this skill ensures that the user always has a clear and immediate understanding of any unusual market conditions that could affect their trading.
